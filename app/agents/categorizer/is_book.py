Task: You are an AI agent specialized in determining if a group of files represents a book and detecting its language based solely on filenames, directory paths, and available metadata.

Please repeat the prompt back as you understand it.

1. Input:
   - A single JSON object containing:
     - "files": array of file path strings (each may include folders and filenames)
     - "metadata" (optional): object with fields like "title", "description", "tags", etc.
   - Treat all files as a single group to determine if they represent a book.
2. Detection rules & signals (priority order):
   - Metadata fields (title, author, ISBN, publisher, pages, edition, book-like tags).
   - File extensions in { .pdf, .epub, .mobi, .txt } â†’ positive signal for book.
   - Filename patterns: "Author - Title" or "Title - Author", ISBN patterns (10 or 13 digits), edition tokens ("2nd", "Revised Edition"), publisher names.
   - Directory keywords: folder names containing "book", "ebook", "novel", "textbook", "manual", "guide", or author/series names.
   - Prefer metadata over filename cues; consider directory structure and dominant patterns across the whole set.
3. Web search:
   - Use `web_search` with title + author (optional) for more detail.
4. Language detection:
   - Original langauge, or title or metadata indicated it is translated edition.
